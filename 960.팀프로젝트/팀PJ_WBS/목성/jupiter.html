          <h1>JUPITER</h1>
          <p>
            Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy
            clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen
            and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the
            lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in
            opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant
            storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

              <strong>Potential for Life</strong>
              <br /><br />
              Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know
              it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize
              this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms
              to adapt to.
              <br /><br />
              While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to
              take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa
              is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar
              system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy
              crust, where life could possibly be supported.

              <br /><br />
              With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11
              times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter
              would be about as big as a basketball.
              <br /><br />
              From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million
              kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun.
              One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from
              the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes
              to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.

          <h3>Surface</h3>
          <p>
            As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is
            mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have
            nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through
            unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside
            the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into
            the planet.
